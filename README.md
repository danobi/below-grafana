![Example panel](./images/example.png)

### Quickstart

To start [Prometheus][2] and [Grafana][3], run:

```
$ docker compose up -d
```

To import some data from the localhost, run:

```
$ ./import.py host --begin "4h ago" --end "2h ago"
```

You may also import snapshots:

```
$ below snapshot --begin "20m ago" --end "now" -o thesnapshot
Snapshot has been created at thesnapshot

$ ./import.py thesnapshot
```

To start plotting graphs, visit `http://localhost:3000` for the grafana UI. The
initial login/password is `admin` and `admin`, respectively.

### Details

The basic idea is we run both prometheus and grafana. We use prometheus as an
intermediate time series database so that we don't have to implement a
grafana datasource plugin.

We then export below's data in [OpenMetrics][1] format and import it into
prometheus.
